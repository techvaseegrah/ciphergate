# Fine Module Documentation

## Overview
The fine module allows administrators to deduct amounts from employee salaries for various reasons such as late coming, misconduct, or other policy violations.

## Features
1. Add fines to employee salaries
2. Automatically deduct fine amounts from employee's final salary
3. Track fine history with date and reason
4. Remove fines if needed (with automatic salary adjustment)

## API Endpoints

- Adds a fine to a worker's record and deducts the amount from their salary
- Request Body:
  ```json
  {
    "amount": 100,
    "date": "2023-10-10",
    "reason": "Late coming"
  }
  ```

### Remove Fine

## Frontend Integration

### Salary Management Page
1. A "Fine" button has been added next to the "Reset Salary" button
2. Clicking the "Fine" button opens a modal with:
   - Employee search functionality
   - Employee selection
   - Fine amount input
   - Date selection
   - Reason text area
3. After submitting, the fine is added to the employee's record and their salary is automatically adjusted

### Worker Model Updates
The Worker model now includes a `fines` array with the following structure:
```javascript
